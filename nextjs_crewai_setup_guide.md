# Setup Guide for Next.js Project: crewai

Since the local environment currently lacks Node.js and we are unable to install it or use Docker for containerization, we are outlining the steps required to set up the project in an environment where Node.js is available.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation Steps
1. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in the terminal.
2. Clone the project repository to your local machine or development environment.
3. Navigate into the project directory.
4. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
5. Once dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the project.

These steps should set up the 'nextjs crewai' project for development in an environment with the proper permissions and software installed.
